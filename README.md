# vrc-pixel-art
just some vrc-related pixel art i'm making because i'm bored

you can use this stuff if you want, you don't *have* to credit me (Liam from 74559A) but it would be kinda neat if you did

you may have to upscale with something like https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/ to make this not appear blurry on documents and stuff
