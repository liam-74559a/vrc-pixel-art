# vrc-pixel-art
just some vrc-related pixel art i'm making because i'm bored

you can use this stuff if you want, you don't *have* to credit me (Liam from 74559A) but it would be kinda neat if you did

you may have to upscale with something like https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/ to make this not appear blurry on documents and stuff

for spritesheets i post, i recommend using https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter to cut them.

i do **not** guarantee that `high-stakes-spritesheet-cut` stays up to date. if you want to be sure you are getting the most up-to-date version of a spritesheet i post, i recommend just cutting it yourself with the aforementioned ezgif website.
